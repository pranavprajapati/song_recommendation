# Song selection based on your favorite artist


The project aims at developing a recommendation system, that uses historical data of the user’s favourite artists’ music, and based on similarity measures, suggests songs that will be similar to the user’s favourite artists’ music. A clustering model will further advocate which recommended similar song will be of a certain genre to create playlists.

Spotify’s API provides something called audio features, which are, as the name implies, features or characteristics of a song.

* I used [Spotipy](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy) , a lightweight Python library for the Spotify Web API to run our scripts for extracting these features.
*  So according to our preferences 10 features were extracted for each song of that particular  artist.
* There were total 219 songs and 1000 more random playlists songs data from 2018.
